The key variables (features) in this dataset, based on feature importance and relevance to the problem of obesity, are:

•	Gender

•	Age:  A person's age may affect their metabolic rate and lifestyle, influencing obesity levels.

•	Height: Useful for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI), which is closely related to obesity.

•	Weight: One of the most critical variables for determining obesity.

•	Family History with Overweight: Whether a person has a genetic predisposition to being overweight or obese, which can significantly impact obesity risk.

•	Frequent Consumption of High-Calorie Food (FAVC): This reflects dietary habits, particularly the consumption of high-calorie foods, which is a known risk factor for obesity.

•	Frequency of Consumption of Vegetables (FCVC): A higher intake of vegetables is typically associated with a healthier diet and lower risk of obesity.

•	Number of Meals (NCP): The number of meals consumed daily can impact weight gain, especially if portion sizes are not controlled.

•	Consumption of Food Between Meals (CAEC): Eating snacks or meals outside of regular eating hours can contribute to weight gain.

•	Smoking Habit (SMOKE): Smoking status can influence metabolism and overall health, affecting obesity.

•	Water Intake (CH2O): Adequate water intake can aid in digestion and prevent overeating, indirectly influencing weight management.

•	Calories Consumed (CALC): Regular or frequent alcohol consumption adds extra calories, contributing to weight gain.

•	Physical Activity Frequency (FAF): Frequency of physical activity is a key factor in energy expenditure and weight control.

•	Time Spent Using Technology (TUE): Time spent on technology or screens is often linked to sedentary behavior, which can contribute to obesity.

•	Transportation Mode (MTRANS): The mode of transportation, such as walking or using public transportation, reflects levels of physical activity in daily life.

•	Outcome variable (NOBeyesdad): Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.
