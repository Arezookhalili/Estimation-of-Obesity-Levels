## Classification of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition Using Data Analysis

### Project Overview

Our aim in this project is to create a machine-learning model based on demographic features (such as age, gender, height, and weight) and lifestyle habits (e.g. eating patterns, exercise, 
smoking, and water intake) for predicting obesity levels. To do so we analyze the dataset titled  "Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition‚Äù (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition) which
contains 16 features and 2111 observations.

### Potential Business Cases in Different Areas

The results of this project can assist various organizations in enhancing their decision-making processes. We have provided a concise summary of key organizations and their potential applications.

#### 1. Public Health Organizations: 
By determining which features in the dataset are the greatest predictors of obesity levels, public health professionals could craft educational campaigns focusing on the most impactful aspects. This would provide insight into what individuals should focus on to reduce their risk of obesity.  

#### 2. Health Care Providers and Practitioners:  
The results could be used by health care professionals to monitor and manage obesity. More specifically it could be applied to help create a health recommendation system by leveraging the identified key variables related to lifestyle habits, dietary patterns, and physical conditions.  Such a system could aid in identifying at risk individuals who could  then be offered interventions and support.  

#### 3. Insurance Companies
The analysis can help in designing custom insurance policies or health premiums based on the identified obesity risks.

### Analysis Goals

- **Leveraging Feature Importance for Public Awareness on Key Factors to Combat Obesity** To create public awareness and highlight the key factors influencing obesity, we  will use feature importance analysis. 

- **Analyzing the Impact of Family History and Habits** This dataset includes features such as family history of overweight and consumption patterns, which will be analyzed to study their impact on obesity levels.

- **Predicting user engagement with technological devices** Determine how technology usage (e.g. smartphone, TV, videogames, computers and other digital tools) correlates with obesity across various age group.
